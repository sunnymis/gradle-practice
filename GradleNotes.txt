Gradle is a build system for Java Applications. 
gradle tasks - Lists all available tasks you can run
gradle build - Compiles, tests, and assembles code into a JAR file. Result will
be in the /build folder. 
/build folder: 
    /classes - Projects compiled .class files
    /reports - Reports produced by the build, i.e unit test reports
    /libs - Assembled libraries, JAR/WAR files
    /dependency_cache - Library dependncies

build.gradle
-  repositories { mavenCentral() } - The repositories block is where you can add
a source for getting 3rd party libraries. Here we are indicating that the dependencies
should come frmo the Maven Central repository. 
- dependencies {
    compile "joda-time:joda-time:2.2"
} 
The dependencies block is wehre you delcare dependencies, i.e Joda Time. 
Version 2.2 of Joda Time library of the Joda Time group. Gradle will download
the jar dependency from https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/joda-time/joda-time/2.2/joda-time-2.2.jar
It is a compile dependency which means that it should be available during compile-time
providedCompile - Type of dependency that is required for compiling the code, but
will be provided at runtime by a container
testCompile - Type of dependency used for compiling and running tests, not 
required for building or running project's runtime code. 
- jar {
    baseName = 'gs-gradle'
    version = '0.1.0'
}
The jar block specifies how the JAR file will be named. This will result in
gs-gradle-0.1.0.jar

Gradle Wrapper - Preferred way of starting a gradle build. It allows you to run
Gradle builds without having it be installed on your system. 
Creates gradlew, gradlew.bat, gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
If you add Gradle wrapper to your version control, people who clone your repo
can build the project the same way as you, without having gradle installed. Also,
they will have the same version of gradle you were using. 
They just have to run: ./gradlew build. 

Making your application runnable, add this to build.gradle
apply plugin: 'application'
mainClassName = 'hello.HelloWorld'

Running the App: 
./gradlew run
